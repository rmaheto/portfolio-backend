- **Contact form with email delivery** â€“ visitors can reach out directly, with **emails generated using Thymeleaf templates** for a personalized format.
- **Template-driven design** â€“ currently includes one template, with plans to support multiple templates in future versions.
- **Scalable backend** â€“ built on Spring Boot with REST APIs, enabling extensibility.
- **Modern frontend** â€“ responsive UI built with Angular.
- **Secure key management** â€“ sensitive keys are externalized, automatically encrypted on first run, and re-encrypted if new keys are added.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/profile2web.git
cd profile2web
```

### 2. Backend (Spring Boot)
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
- Runs on **http://localhost:8090** by default.
- Update `application.yml` as needed for server configs.

### 3. Frontend (Angular)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```
- Runs on **http://localhost:4200** by default.
- Update `environment.ts` to point to your backend API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8090/api`).

### 4. Database Setup
- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- Update backend `application.properties` with your DB connection.
- Run schema migrations (if provided in `/resources`).

### 5. Properties & Keys Setup
This project externalizes sensitive keys (email credentials, reCAPTCHA secrets, etc.) into a properties file.

1. Create a folder named **`keys`** in the **root directory** of your system.
    - On **Windows**: `C:/keys`
    - On **Linux/Mac**: `/keys`

2. Inside the `keys` folder, create a file named `application-keys.properties`.  
   Example contents:
   ```properties
   EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD.key=your_password_here
   GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET.key=your_recaptcha_secret
   ```

3. On first run, the application will automatically **encrypt all sensitive keys** found in the file.
    - Encrypted keys are stored securely, and the application transparently uses the decrypted values at runtime.
    - Any new keys added later will also be encrypted when the application is re-run.

### 6. Email Configuration
Configure SMTP credentials in the `application-keys.properties` file as above. The Spring Boot backend will load and use these settings to send contact form emails using Thymeleaf templates.
